# Professional Certificate in Data Science - Harvard University
Welcome to this repository containing code examples, exercises, and datasets for the Professional Certificate in Data Science offered by Harvard University through the edX platform. The program is led by Professor Rafael Irizarry from the T.H. Chan School of Public Health and covers a range of topics in data science, including:

- R Basics
- Visualization
- Probability
