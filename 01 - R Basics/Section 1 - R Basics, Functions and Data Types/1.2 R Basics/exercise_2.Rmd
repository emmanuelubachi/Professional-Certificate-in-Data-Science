## Exercise
### Using Variables 2
What is the sum of the first 1000 positive integers?
We can use the formula _n(n+1)/2_ to quickly compute this quantity.

## Instruction
* Use the same formula as the last exercise but change the value of _n_. Make sure you use the variable name _n_ to store the value 1000.
* Instead of typing the result, use the formula and defined variable.

```{r}
# Below, write code to calculate the sum of the first 1000 integers

# solution
n <- 1000
n*(n+1)/2
```
