## Exercise
### Using Variables 1
What is the sum of the first _n_ positive integers?
We can use the formula _n(n+1)/2_ to quickly compute this quantity.

## Instruction
* Define _n<-100_
* Then use R to compute the sum of 1 through 100 using the formula _n(n+1)/2_. What is the sum?
* Make sure you do not erase or change the sample code on DataCamp exercises.

```{r}
# Here is how you compute the sum for the first 20 integers
20*(20+1)/2 

# However, we can define a variable to use the formula for other values of n
n <- 20
n*(n+1)/2

n <- 25
n*(n+1)/2

# Below, write code to calculate the sum of the first 100 integers

# solution
n <- 100
n*(n+1)/2
```
