## Exercise
### Nested function calls 1
In math and programming we say we evaluate a function when we replace arguments with specific values. So if we type _log2(16)_ we evaluate the _log2_ function to get the log base 2 of _16_ which is _4_.

In R it is often useful to evaluate a function inside another function. For example, _sqrt(log2(16))_ will calculate the log to the base 2 of 16 and then compute the square root of that value. So the first evaluation gives a 4 and this gets evaluated by _sqrt_ to give the final answer of 2.

## Instruction
* Use one line of code to compute the log, to the base 10, of the square root of 100.
* Make sure your code includes the _log10_ and _sqrt_ functions.

```{r}
# log to the base 2 
log2(16)

# sqrt of the log to the base 2 of 16:
sqrt(log2(16))

# Compute log to the base 10 (log10) of the sqrt of 100. Do not use variables.
## Solution
log10(sqrt(100))
```
